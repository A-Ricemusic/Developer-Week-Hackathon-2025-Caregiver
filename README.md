## **Project Overview**

Caregiver is built to address the **complex needs** of **assisted living facilities** by offering a combination of **AI-powered assistance**, **event tracking**, and **data visualization**. The application features a conversational **chatbot** powered by **Hugging Face Transformers**, which allows administrators to retrieve **medical information, resident statistics, and facility updates** through natural language queries.

Additionally, the system integrates **Redis** as a **vector database** and a **conversation history store**, ensuring that AI responses remain **contextually relevant**.

Key **functional components** include:

- **Conversational AI assistant** for medical and facility-related queries
- **Real-time event notifications** sent via **Twilio SMS**
- **Dynamic SQL-based data visualizations** in **Oracle APEX**
- **An interactive memory game** designed to engage residents cognitively

The Caregiver **frontend** is built using **Oracle APEX**, which provides **SQL-driven dashboards** for administrators to monitor resident health trends and facility operations.

---

## **Key Features**

- **AI-Powered Assistance:** Uses **DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen 1.5B** to provide medical insights and facility-related information.
- **Vector Database (Redis):** Stores event data and health statistics for efficient AI retrieval.
- **Conversation History:** Enables contextual, personalized AI interactions.
- **Data Visualization:** SQL-based dashboards in **Oracle APEX** present key health metrics.
- **SMS Notifications:** Daily event reminders sent via **Twilio API**.
- **Interactive Memory Game:** AI-powered historical guessing game to engage residents.

---

## **Technology Stack**

- **LLM:** Hugging Face Transformers (**DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen 1.5B**, distilled from DeepSeek R1 Zero)
- **Database:** Redis (Vector database + Key-Value store for chatbot memory)
- **Frontend:** Oracle APEX
- **Data Visualization:** SQL queries (Oracle APEX dashboards)
- **Event Notifications:** Twilio API (SMS reminders)
- **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Deployment:** Docker, Hugging Face Spaces

## **Backend API (`backend-api`)**

The **backend API** is hosted on **Hugging Face Spaces** and serves as the **core logic layer**. It interacts with the **AI model, Redis database, and Twilio API** to provide real-time responses and event notifications.

### **Key Components:**

- **`app.py`**
  - Handles API requests
  - Integrates with the **LLM (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen 1.5B or Minstrel)** for medical chatbot functionality
  - Queries the Redis vector database for event lookups
  - Key API endpoints:
    - `/api/data`: AI-powered medical & facility chatbot
    - `/api/games/start`: Starts the **Memory Game**
    - `/api/games/question`: Fetches historical clues from the AI
    - `/api/games/guess`: Processes user guesses

- **`event_notifier.py`**
  - Queries the Redis vector database for upcoming events
  - Sends **daily SMS reminders** to administrators using **Twilio API**

---

## **Installation**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/caregiver.git
   cd caregiver
   ```
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up Redis database and initialize vectors:
